# Trybers-Dragons

## Description

The project is a challenge to consolidate the learning of TypeScript along with the principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). With this, we created a system of an RPG (Role-Playing Gaming) game in which players (who have races and archetypes), monsters, dragons and a PVP (Player vs Player) and PVE fighting system are created. (Player vs Environment).
